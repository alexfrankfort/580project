The purpose of our project is to provide switch-based users with an interactive game that can be 
played with another person in a way that makes the switch user a necessary player in enabling 
game progression. This would allow for interaction between an able-bodied person and a person 
with disabilities that they might not get under normal circumstances in a fun, friendly environment.

The arrow keys are used for movement. Left and right are used to maneuver to the left/right, and 
up allows the character to jump. The space bar is used to cycle through characters, while the 
enter key cycles backwards through the characters. Space bar and enter keys are meant to be 
utilized by the switch user while an able-bodied individual controls the character with the arrow keys.

The goal of the game is to reach the end of the level and touch the gold block at the end of each 
level while avoiding lava (the red blocks). Touching the block will progress the players to the 
next level. There are currently five levels.

To get through the level, you must change the character to activate certain blocks. To activate a 
block, you must match the color of the character to the color of the block, and then touch it. This 
will cause various functionalities to occur, such as unlocking a door, or cooling lava so that it can 
be touched without harm. Progressing through levels will unlock additional characters, and the 
colors needed increase as time goes on. 

This project was done in html, css, and javascript. There are no prerequisites for installing the 
game. It is designed to be played in a browser that can use the aforementioned software.
